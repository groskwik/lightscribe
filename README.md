# Lightscribe Disc Preview Generator

This project creates realistic previews of **Lightscribe gold discs** by applying colorization, contrast enhancement, and compositing steps to an input image.

## 🧩 Overview

Lightscribe discs are optical media (CD/DVD) that use a laser to etch grayscale images directly onto the label side, resulting in a sepia-like image on a reflective gold surface.  
This script simulates that appearance from a regular image, producing a gold-tinted, etched-looking output suitable for product listings or previews.
